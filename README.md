# Grocery Store Database Design & SQL Queries

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a normalized database design for a grocery store using SQL. The goal was to develop a structured database that manages information about products, vendors, inventory, customers, sales, and sales details. Various SQL queries were created to test and prove the database design's functionality, helping the grocery store gain insights into sales performance, vendor activity, and customer behavior.

## Database Design
The design consists of six main tables:

1. **Products**: Stores product information such as product ID, name, description, category, price, and unit.
2. **Vendors**: Contains details about vendors, including vendor ID, name, address, and contact information.
3. **InventoryS**: Manages inventory data, including product IDs, quantities, costs, purchase dates, vendor IDs, and locations.
4. **Customers**: Contains customer information, such as customer ID, name, address, phone number, and email.
5. **Sales**: Records sales transactions, linking customer ID, sale date, and total amount.
6. **SalesDetails**: Stores details about each sale, such as product IDs, quantities sold, and price per unit.

## SQL Queries
Several SQL queries were developed to test the database functionality, including:

1. **Find Best-Selling Items**: Query to retrieve the best-selling products based on total quantity sold.
2. **Find Top Vendors**: Query to identify vendors supplying the most products.
3. **Find Customers Who Bought the Most Items**: Query to identify the customers who purchased the most items.
4. **Total Revenue Per Product Category**: Query to calculate total revenue for each product category.
5. **Customer Revenue Breakdown**: Query to break down the revenue generated by each customer.

## Key Findings
- The database design allows for efficient tracking of sales performance, inventory levels, and vendor data.
- Key insights such as top-selling products, vendor contributions, and customer behavior were successfully extracted using SQL queries.
- The database structure is scalable, providing flexibility for future enhancements such as adding product promotions or discount features.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing triggers to automatically update inventory when a sale is made.
- Adding a promotions table for tracking product discounts.
- Enhancing customer data by including preferences or loyalty programs.

## Conclusion Report
In this project, I designed and implemented a relational database for a grocery store, focusing on functionality, scalability, and data integrity. Key challenges included normalizing data and managing incomplete entries. I created SQL queries to test and validate the database, generating insights into best-selling products, vendor activity, and customer purchasing patterns. The project stands out due to its practical use case, providing direct value to business operations. Future improvements include adding a promotions table, integrating predictive analytics, and enhancing user authentication.
